# CLZ Parser

This is a silly tool for parsing the XML files that you get from
[CLZ Games Cloud](https://cloud.collectorz.com/) and extracting data that I
find interesting.

I intend to use this with my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@amazingcriswell5965).
Could be useful to others, who knows?
